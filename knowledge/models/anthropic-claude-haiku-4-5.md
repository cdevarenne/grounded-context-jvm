The fastest model in the current lineup, and the one that differs most from its siblings.

**Two exact facts a ranked answer tends to blur.** First, `model_string`
(`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) and `api_alias` (`claude-haiku-4-5`) are different strings and only
one of them is the pinned snapshot ID — a retrieval that returns "the model ID" without saying
which is not actually answering the question. Second, this model inverts its siblings on
thinking: `adaptive_thinking` is **false** and `extended_thinking` is **true**, the opposite of
Opus 5 and Sonnet 5. Any generalization across the family is wrong here, which is why the fields
are per-model rather than described once in prose.

No Message Batches 300k-output entry: this model is not listed as supporting it, so the field is
absent rather than guessed.
