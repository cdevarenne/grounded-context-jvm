The speed/intelligence balance point in the current lineup.

**Why pricing needs four canonical fields, not one sentence.** Standard pricing is $3/$15 per
MTok, but introductory pricing of $2/$10 applies through 2026-08-31. Both are exact, both are
true, and which one applies depends on the date the question is asked. A prose summary has to
pick one and will be wrong half the time; four dated fields are correct on both sides of the
boundary.
